## **Introduction**

In this case study, I’ll be performing many real-world tasks that a data analyst usually does in their day-to-day job. I’ll be working with a fictional company named Cyclist and answer key business questions, in order to do that I’ll be following the six-step data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyse, share and act.

## **Scenario**

I’m a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclists, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. That being the case I need to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclists bikes differently. From these insights, I will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclists executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations, that I’ll do my best to provide below.

## **Phases**

### **Ask**

Our goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, the next three questions will be a great guide to get there:

- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclists bikes differently?
-	What would make casual riders buy a membership?
-	How can Cyclists use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
  
To answer these questions, our marketing director is interested in analysing the Cyclists historical bike trip data to identify trends.

### **Prepare**

The data for this project consisted of 12 months of cyclist data from January to December 2023. Each month’s data was downloaded as a separate zipped CSV file. After unzipping the files, I converted them to .xls format for easier manipulation in Excel.

### **Process**

Upon initial inspection of the data, I noticed that four columns had a significant number of missing values. 
These columns were start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id , also there were another four columns start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, and end_lng. As these columns were not relevant to my analysis, I decided to remove them. The remaining columns in the dataset were:

1.	rider_id
2.	rideable_type
3.	started_at
4.	ended_at
5.	member_casual
